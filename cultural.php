Initially confined to the arena of public-speaking, it was decided that the club would expand its ventures and dabble in other literary fields too. The society encourages and provides a platform to budding writers and orators to put forth their views. The society is a vibrant one, with lots of regular and interesting activities like Debates and GDs, that both serve to be fun as well as beneficial. Every student taking part in these activities is encouraged to come out of his/her shell and start communicating effectively.<br><br>
                      GOALS has a weekly online edition - EXPRESSO, which features artistic literary works. The society also has its own newsletter, called the Couch Potato. The contents are typically informal and talk about the most interesting things happening in and around the campus. As GOALS works for nurturing the speaking and writing skills of its members, for developing critical thinking and leadership abilities it organises MUN - Model United Nations. In all, it is a society that's definitely worth joining, if you want a major upgrade to your public skills!
